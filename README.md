# Motivation

Walking through different cities in USA it can be seen that there are people trying to survive. They are living to survive. I always wonder what can be done. I lacked those first steps on how to even start.

They say the best way is to just start by attempting something. Even the basis is a start.

Consider this one of many basis. This page should grow more as we get to know better ways to help.

In this page we want to highlight kits that can be given to people to have a better chance of surviving. Besides that we want to bring awareness of this starting point.

The contents of this page is expected to change the more we learn and adapt to situations.
